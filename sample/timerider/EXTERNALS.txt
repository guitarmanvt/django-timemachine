# NOTE: By default, this checks out the timemachine in a writeable state.
# This requires commit-access to the SVN for this project.
# If you want to just check it out and see how it works, then 
# change the "https" to "http" and run:
#   svn propset svn:externals -F EXTERNALS.txt .
# in your "timerider" directory.
# Then perform an "svn update" to get the latest externals.
