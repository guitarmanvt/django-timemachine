INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
This sample Django project is intended to demo the django-timemachine app.

PRE-REQUISITES
--------------
1. Download and install Django from http://djangoproject.com/ .
2. Do the Django tutorial.  It's easy, fun and it'll give you a background for this.
3. Get Subversion from http://subversion.tigris.org/
If you want to contribute:
4. Get a Google Code account at http://code.google.com/ .
5. Ping us, so we can figure out how to grant you access.  (It's still very new to us.)

GETTING THE READ-ONLY VERSION
-----------------------------
This is intended for those who just want to kick the tires.  If you want to contribute, skip to the next section.

1. Check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP:
$ svn checkout http://django-timemachine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk django-timemachine

GETTING THE WRITEABLE VERSION
-----------------------------
This is intended for those who want to contribute.

1. Check out a working copy over HTTPS:
$ svn checkout https://django-timemachine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk django-timemachine

CONFIGURATION
-------------
This is designed to run right away. If you want, you can create your own
settings, so you can customize things. Do it like this:
1. Create a my_settings.py file.
$ cp settings.py my_settings.py
2. Edit my_settings.py; setup your own versions of things like LOCAL_ROOT.
3. Run django using your own settings. Use the "--settings" switch, like this:
$ python manage.py --settings my_settings syncdb

RUNNING THE PROJECT
-------------------
1. The first time, you will need to setup your database:
$ python manage.py syncdb

2. After that, you can start the development server:
$ python manage.py runserver

3. Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to see the admin interface.

(Right now, there's not much more to see. Start coding! ;)

Have fun!
